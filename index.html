        <b>Hi!</b> I'm a software developer from Croatia.
    </p>

    <p>
        I've spent most of my 10+ year career at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon</a>: leading,
        designing, implementing, and maintaining complex software systems.
        My main focus were distributed systems, data streaming, and cloud services.
        I was also one of the lead devs for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/msk/features/msk-connect/" target="_blank">AWS
        MSK Connect</a> (and even got promoted to senior SDE &#128526;).
    </p>

    <p>Before Amazon, I worked at <a href="https://www.ingemark.com/" target="_blank">Ingemark</a> - a software agency
        from Croatia.</p>

    <h2 class="page-heading">Skills</h2>
    <p>
        I'm most comfortable coding in Java and TypeScript, but I also have solid experience with Go and Ruby.

        Regarding some software-related technologies, I have a lot of experience with AWS, Apache Kafka and Kubernetes.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've been mostly working as a backend dev, but I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty with frontend and low-level
        dev work (e.g. Linux networking).

    </p>
    <p>
        Since most of my experience comes from Amazon, I'm used to developing/maintaining software at a massive scale,
        under strict requirements for high availability and throughput, and low cost and latency.
    </p>
