  <h2 class="page-heading">About me</h2>

  <p>
    Hi! I'm a software developer from Croatia.
  </p>

  <p>
    I started my professional carrier at <a href="http://www.ingemark.com/" target="_blank">Ingemark</a>
    as a fullstack developer.
  </p>

  <p>
    During my rather short career, I've worked on various projects written in various programming languages
    such as Java, Ruby and JavaScript.
    <br>
    Java remains my preferred and mostly used language and somehow I'm most comfortable writing stuff in it.
    <br>
    Beside that, I'm very interested in the Rust programming language and I would really like to use it professionally one day.
  </p>
