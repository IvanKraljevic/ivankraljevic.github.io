  <h2 class="page-heading">About me</h2>

  <p>
    Hi! I'm a software developer from Croatia.
  </p>

  <p>
    I've spent most of my 10+ year career at Amazon: leading, designing, implementing, and maintaining complex software systems. Mostly focusing on distributed systems,
    data streaming, and cloud services. I was also one of the lead devs for AWS MSK Connect (and even got promoted to senior SDE).
    <br>
    Before Amazon, I worked at <a href="http://www.ingemark.com/" target="_blank">Ingemark</a> - a software agency from Croatia.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm most comfortable coding in Java and TypeScript, but I also have solid experience with Go and Ruby.

    <br>

    Regarding some software-related technologies, I have a lot of experience with AWS, Apache Kafka and Kubernetes.

    <br>

    I've been mostly working as a backend dev, but I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty with frontend and low-level dev work (e.g. Linux networking).

    <br>
    Since most of my experience comes from Amazon, I'm used to developing/maintaining software at a massive scale, under strict requirements for high availability and throughput, and low cost and latency.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm currently looking for a remote position, preferably within the EU or US East Coast time zones. Feel free to reach out and chat!
  </p>
